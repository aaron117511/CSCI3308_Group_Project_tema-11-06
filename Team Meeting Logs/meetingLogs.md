# Team Meeting 4/12
During this meeting, we came up with a plan to have the /login and /register apis functional and test cases written for them, while also beginning to implement
the Spotify API registration functionality into our application. We discussed beginning work on some of the Spotify features of our app, but we decided that
once this groundwork of connecting the user to their Spotify account is laid, we should be able to work on features of the app itself as efficiently as possible.

Responsibilities were divided as follows:
- Jamison, River, and Andrew would design the /login and /register apis and their tests, as per Lab 11, back-end and front-end. They would also come up with
test case plans for future features, as per Lab 11.
- Berkley and Aaron would implement functionality that would connect these apis to the login and registration of our website, using Spotify's API key system.

In addition, anyone who finished their responsibilities could pick up tasks if they had time to implement small front-end functionality to the app, such as
making the password bar in the login/registration fields hidden, or making the navbar buttons functional.
